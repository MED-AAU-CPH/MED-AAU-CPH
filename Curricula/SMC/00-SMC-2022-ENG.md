natural perception and interaction (e.g., virtual reality).

The objective of this module is to design, develop and evaluate
immersive applications (AR/VR/XR), where knowledge of perceptual and
cognitive affordances and limitations is explicitly utilized to optimize
the efficacy of the immersive application according to a desired set of
parameters or requirements.

The module requires students to draw on fields and disciplines such as
cognitive psychology and cognitive ergonomics, **sonic** interaction

MED9 POSEO also works for SMC9 \... it is generic enough. Only thing we
would suggest changing is the person \"responsible for the module\" - as
you can see here, it\'s Claus for MED9:

Dan could be responsible for the SMC9 POSEOs?

**Course Module**: **Music Perception and Cognition**

Music has held an important place in all cultures around the world for
millennia, and recently technology has made music increasingly
accessible in daily activities and integral in most digital media.
Musical information may encode musical sound, perceived musical
structure, the affective or semantic content of music, musical gestures
or musical interactions. The ability to design and build effective and
efficient computing systems for processing musical information requires
an understanding of how music information is created, represented,
communicated and processed by humans.

This course introduces experimental, theoretical, computational and
neuroscientific work that has contributed to our understanding of how
musical information is created, represented, communicated and processed,
both in the brain and the body, when humans perform musical tasks such
as listening, dancing, performing, composing and improvising.

**Learning objectives**

**Knowledge**

Students who complete the module will obtain:

-   understanding of the main paradigms, concepts and disciplines that
    contribute to music perception and cognition research and which have
    relevance for sound and music computing systems

-   understanding of how perceptual constraints as well as cultural
    influence shape how musical information is communicated and
    experienced.

-   Understanding of the basic cognitive and motoric mechanisms
    underlying human music performance and interactions

**Skills**

Students who complete the module will be able to: 

-   apply knowledge on human music perception and cognition in the
    design of sound and music computing systems

<!-- -->

-   apply theories and models of music perception and cognition to
    evaluate sound and music computing systems

-   apply experimental methodologies in the design and execution of
    appropriate experiments for testing hypotheses in the field of music
    perception and cognition.

**Competences**

Students who complete the module will be able to:

-   synthesize knowledge and theoretical frameworks from a variety of
    relevant sources and disciplines, which contribute to the study of
    technology-cognition interaction and apply this knowledge in the
    design of sound and music computing systems

-   analyze and interpret current experimental, theoretical and
    computational research in music perception and cognition.
