## Content, progress and pedagogy of the module

**Objectives**

Most emerging media is inherently multisensory and offers varying degrees of technological immersion, ranging from screen-based displays (e.g., smartphones and tablets) to fully immersive displays enabling
natural perception and interaction (e.g., virtual reality).

The objective of this module is to design, develop and evaluate
immersive applications (AR/VR/XR), where knowledge of perceptual and
cognitive affordances and limitations is explicitly utilized to optimize
the efficacy of the immersive application according to a desired set of
parameters or requirements.

The module requires students to draw on fields and disciplines such as
cognitive psychology and cognitive ergonomics, **sonic** interaction
design or multimodal interaction, to design and evaluate
compelling/engaging experiences explicitly founded on scientifically
sound perceptual and cognitive considerations.

### Learning objectives

#### Knowledge

Students who complete the module will obtain:

- understanding of types of immersive systems, interaction
  technologies and technological factors influencing immersiveness
- understanding of core aspects of human perception and cognition and
  how these might pertain to the **sonic** interaction with content in
  multimodal systems and to aspects of immersiveness

#### Skills

Students who complete the module will be able to:

- implement immersive media systems utilizing state-of-the-art
  technologies and concepts
- analyze the applicability and affordance of perceptual and cognitive
  processes in the context of immersive media systems

With respect to Problem-Based Learning students will be able to:

- produce a project report according to norms of the area, take into
  consideration relevant literature, apply correct terminology and
  convey the research-based foundation, problem and results of the
  project orally and in writing in a coherent manner, including the
  relationship between the problem formulation, the project's
  realization and its conclusions
- evaluate and select relevant literature, scientific methods and
  models and other tools for application in the project work, and
  evaluate the project's problem area in a relevant scientific context

#### Competences

Students who complete the module will be able to:

- create and evaluate perceptually optimized immersive media
  systems/experiences based on utilizing affordances or limitations in
  perceptual and cognitive processes

With respect to Problem-Based Learning students will be able to:

- plan, execute and manage complex research and/or development tasks,
  and assume a professional responsibility for carrying out,
  potentially cross-disciplinary, collaborations
- assume responsibility for own scientific development and
  specialization

### Type of instruction

Academically supervised student-governed problem oriented project work

## Exam

### Prerequisite for enrollment for the exam

- An approved PBL competency profile is a prerequisite for participation in the project exam
