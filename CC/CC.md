# Code of Conduct (CoC) at CREATE

[AAU CoC](https://www.staff.aau.dk/rules/staff-affairs/code-of-conduct) is a good start, but it is rather brief and unspecfic for research integrity, comparted to [KU CoC](https://research.ku.dk/integrity/code-of-conduct), for example.

We all must follow the Danish CoC: [https://ufm.dk/en/publications/2014/files-2014-1/the-danish-code-of-conduct-for-research-integrity.pdf](https://ufm.dk/en/publications/2014/files-2014-1/the-danish-code-of-conduct-for-research-integrity.pdf)

## On the authorship of the VIP/Student submissions

- Authors of a paper are normally stated according to their contribution
- Authors should decide the order of authorship together.
- It might be required that you make a concise explanation on how the order was decided. There are however different standards.
  - For some disciplines (e.g., psychology), the first author is the most important, for others (e.g., medicine) it is the last author.
  - ERC and other important grants will count only the first or last authorship.
- Authors of a paper are people who contributed substantially to the paper in a significant way and can account for the full content of the paper or a specific section very well. (**accountability)**
- Acquisition of funding, technical services (e.g., paid statistical analysis service or programming of products), consortium participation (e.g., ethical, methodological, or statistical advice to a consortium), material acquisition (e.g., buying resources or collecting data), or coordination (e.g., being the head of the research group conducting the research) is not enough to be listed as author of a paper.
- All authors should participate in writing the manuscript, reviewing the drafts, and approving the final submission.
- One of the authors (AKA the corresponding author) should take care of the work as a whole, even if they worked partially in the production.
  These authors oversee preparing the material for the submission.
- Every person contributing in these ways to the manuscript has the right to be an author.

## Dissemination of Co-supervised / Jointly Supervised work

A supervisor and the student cannot publish a research paper without inviting the other joint or co-supervisor. It is important to discuss authorship with all contributors and obtaining their approval. excluding a co-supervisor from the publication process, especially without their knowledge or consent, contradicts the principles of transparency, accountability, and ethical conduct outlined in the Danish CoC .

* **All authors should participate in the publication process:** This includes reviewing drafts and approving the final submission.
* **Authorship decisions should be transparent and collaborative:** Authors should decide the order of authorship together.
  Additionally, a concise explanation of how the order was decided might be required.
* **Ethical considerations:** Leaving out a supervisor who contributed to the project could be considered **misconduct.**
* **Supervisors' rights in student-led projects:** Even when students propose, shape, and develop a project, professors who provide significant supervision and guidance are entitled to be listed as authors.
* **Collaborative research guidelines:** The sources highlight the importance of clear agreements in collaborative research, and authorship is a key aspect that should be discussed and agreed upon by all collaborating partners.
