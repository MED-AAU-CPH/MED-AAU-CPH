# **Course Module**: **Music Perception and Cognition**

Music has held an important place in all cultures around the world for
millennia, and recently technology has made music increasingly
accessible in daily activities and integral in most digital media.
Musical information may encode musical sound, perceived musical
structure, the affective or semantic content of music, musical gestures
or musical interactions. The ability to design and build effective and
efficient computing systems for processing musical information requires
an understanding of how music information is created, represented,
communicated and processed by humans.

This course introduces experimental, theoretical, computational and
neuroscientific work that has contributed to our understanding of how
musical information is created, represented, communicated and processed,
both in the brain and the body, when humans perform musical tasks such
as listening, dancing, performing, composing and improvising.

## **Learning objectives**

### **Knowledge**

Students who complete the module will obtain:

- understanding of the main paradigms, concepts and disciplines that
  contribute to music perception and cognition research and which have
  relevance for sound and music computing systems
- understanding of how perceptual constraints as well as cultural
  influence shape how musical information is communicated and
  experienced.
- Understanding of the basic cognitive and motoric mechanisms
  underlying human music performance and interactions

### **Skills**

Students who complete the module will be able to:Â 

- apply knowledge on human music perception and cognition in the
  design of sound and music computing systems
- apply theories and models of music perception and cognition to
  evaluate sound and music computing systems
- apply experimental methodologies in the design and execution of
  appropriate experiments for testing hypotheses in the field of music
  perception and cognition.

### **Competences**

Students who complete the module will be able to:

- synthesize knowledge and theoretical frameworks from a variety of
  relevant sources and disciplines, which contribute to the study of
  technology-cognition interaction and apply this knowledge in the
  design of sound and music computing systems
- analyze and interpret current experimental, theoretical and
  computational research in music perception and cognition.
