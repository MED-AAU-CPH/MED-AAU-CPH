# Code of Conduct (CoC) at CREATE

[AAU CoC](https://www.staff.aau.dk/rules/staff-affairs/code-of-conduct) is a good start, but it is rather brief and unspecfic for research integrity, comparted to [KU CoC](https://research.ku.dk/integrity/code-of-conduct), for example.

We all must follow the Danish CoC: [https://ufm.dk/en/publications/2014/files-2014-1/the-danish-code-of-conduct-for-research-integrity.pdf](https://ufm.dk/en/publications/2014/files-2014-1/the-danish-code-of-conduct-for-research-integrity.pdf)
