## 16: Competence profile of the programme


### **Knowledge**

Students who complete the Sound and Music Computing (SMC) specialization of the programme will obtain:

- knowledge and understanding of state-of-the-art sound and music technologies.
- understanding sound and music perception and cognitionin relation to sound and music applications.

With respect to Problem-Based Learning students will be able to:

- account for the scientific foundation, and scientific problem areas
- describe the state of the art of relevant research

### **Skills**

Students who complete the programme will be able to:

- analyze an application area of sound and music computing, use case and/or user group in order to generate a requirement
  specification
- evaluate the limitations and affordances of state-of-the-art sound and music computing solutions in relation to a specific
  application area, for example health, culture or entertainment.
- create novel sound and music computing base solutions.

With respect to Problem-Based Learning students will be able to:

- master the scientific methods and general skills associated with the problem area
- produce a project report according to norms of the area, apply correct terminology, document extensive command over relevant
  literature,
- communicate and discuss the research-based foundation, problem and results of the project orally, graphically and in writing in a coherent manner
- critically evaluate the results of the project in relation to relevant literature and established scientific methods and models, evaluate and discuss the project’s problem area in a relevant scientific context
- evaluate and discuss the project’s potential form further development

### **Competences**

Students who complete the programme will be able to:

- conceive, design, implement and evaluate prototypes of sound and music computing products targeted at specific users/use cases.

With respect to Problem-Based Learning students will be able to:

- participate in, and independently carry out, technological development and research, and apply scientific methods in solving
  complex problems
- plan, execute and manage complex research and/or development tasks, and assume a professional responsibility for independently carrying out, potentially cross-disciplinary, collaborations
- independently assume responsibility for own scientific development
