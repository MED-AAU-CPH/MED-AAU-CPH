## **Master's Thesis**

2026/2027

### **Content, progress and pedagogy of the module**

#### **Objectives**

The objective of the module is to document that the student,
independently or in a small group, is capable of planning and completing
a major research and/or development project in the area of Media
Technology **Specialization: Sound and Music Computing (SMC)**. The
project must document the student's ability to apply scientific theories
and methods, critically analyse existing work, and synthesize new
knowledge and solutions **in the specialization (SMC)**.

#### **Learning objectives**

##### 1. Knowledge

> Students who complete the module will obtain:

* thorough understanding of the affordances and limitations posed by the application context of the chosen specialization project, both from a user/use-case perspective and a technological perspective

> With respect to Problem-Based Learning students will be able to
>
> - account for the scientific foundation, and scientific problem areas
> - describe the state of the art of relevant research
>
> **of the specialization (SMC)**.

##### 2. Skills

> Students who complete the module will be able to:

* design and carry out iterative development processes that generate knowledge of users and/or relevant media technological solutions, and feed this knowledge into optimizing the user experience or other relevant performance metrics

> **in the Sound and Music Computing specialization**.
>
> With respect to Problem-Based Learning students will be able to:

* master the scientific methods and general skills associated with the problem area
* produce a project report according to norms of the area, apply correct terminology, document extensive command over relevant literature, communicate and discuss the research-based foundation, problem and results of the project orally, graphically and in writing in a coherent manner
* critically evaluate the results of the project in relation to relevant literature and established scientific methods and models, evaluate and discuss the project's problem area in a relevant scientific context
* evaluate and discuss the project's potential for further development

> **of the specialization (SMC)**.

##### 3. Competences

> Students who complete the module will be able to:

* systematically conceive, design, implement, and evaluate prototypes of digital media products targeted at specific users and/or use-cases
* design and carry out scientifically sound experiments to evaluate media products, as well as analysing and communicating the results thereof

> **in the Sound and Music Computing (SMC) Specialization**
>
> With respect to Problem-Based Learning students will be able to:

* participate in, and independently carry out, technological development and research, and apply scientific methods in solving complex problems
* plan, execute and manage complex research and/or development tasks, and assume a professional responsibility for independently carrying out, potentially cross-disciplinary, collaborations
* independently assume responsibility for own scientific development

> **in the specialization (SMC)**.

### **Type of instruction**

Academically supervised student-governed problem oriented project work.
The project is carried out individually or in small groups of a maximum
of three students. At least one internal supervisor is assigned, who
deals with the primary area of the **specialization (SMC)** in his or
her research.
