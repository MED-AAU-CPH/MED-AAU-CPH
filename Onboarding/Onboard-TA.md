# Teaching Assistant (TA)

If you are a new teaching assistant, welcome to Create. HR should have gotten your personal and educational details, and provided you a work contract **for a specific duration**.

Ask from your supervisor (who is teaching the course you are helping at the BSc or MSc level) a job description with a breakdown of activities. 

Be mindful about how much each activity takes your time, in planning and running.

You will record your working hours monthly or bi-weekly. Be specific, inspirational, and helpful to all learners. 

## For VIP: Hiring a TA

For each semester, each teaching VIP will receive an email about

- how much TA hours your courses are allocated
- a list of existing TAs,
- possibility of hiring a new TA, with required documents.

If you propose to hire a new TA, ensure and document their relevant experience. A template for HR is provided here.

Be mindful that MED has a diverse age and background:

* An MSc in 2024 had first year students between 22 and 32, with all sorts of backgrounds.
* We hired a TA from BSc who is 27 to help them, documenting the relevant experience in programming and embedded machine learning.

Official rules are interpreted as

1. "must have completed first 2 years of BSc studies” and
2. “if the student is clearly qualified then even Rule#1 doesn’t matter”
